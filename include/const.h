 * Huffman tree in the format produced by emit_huffman_tree(), and it reconstructs
 * the tree from the description.  First two bytes are read, and the number of
 * nodes n and the number of leaf nodes (n+1)/2 are computed from them.
 * Then, a sequence of n bits is read (8 bits per byte) and the tree structure is
 * built.  This is done using a stack of nodes: when a 0 bit is read, a node is
 * initialized as a leaf and pushed onto the stack, and when a 1 bit is read,
 * two nodes, first R then L, are popped from the stack and are made the right
 * and left children, respectively of a new internal node, which is then pushed
 * back onto the stack.  After n bits have been processed in this way, the one
 * node that remains on the stack is the root of the tree.  Finally, the sequence of
 * bytes that specifies the symbol values to be stored at the leaves of the tree
 * is read, and these values are stored at the leaves in left-to-right order.
 *
 * @return 0 if the tree is read and reconstructed without error, otherwise 1
 * if an error occurs.
